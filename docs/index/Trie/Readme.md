# Trie Implementation

## Introduction
Java implementation of Trie data structure. 

[dsa.prob_trie.java](./src/dsa/prob_trie.java) file contains a sample Trie implementation. 
This test reads instructions from data/trie_test1_input.txt 

There are two instructions: add and find
- If an instruction is add, then it adds the given value to Trie. 
- If an instructions is find, then it finds the number of prefixes matched. This is retrieval function.

Input: data/trie_test1_input.txt
