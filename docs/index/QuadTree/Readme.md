# Trie Implementation

## Introduction
Java implementation of Quad Tree data structure. 

[dsa.prob_quad.java](./src/dsa/prob_quad.java) file contains a sample Quad Tree implementation. 
This test reads instructions from data/quad_test1_input.txt 

There are two instructions: add and find
- If an instruction is **add**, then it adds the given value to Quad Tree. 
- If an instructions is **find**, then it finds the number of locations within (center,radiius). This is retrieval function.

Input: data/quad_test1_input.txt
